            <h2>Why Prague?</h2>
            <h3>Prague, the City of a Hundred Spires</h3>
            <p>
              Looking at the Czech capital form the gates of Prague Castle
              located high above the city, one cannot be surprised by the
              nickname "Prague the city of a hundred spires". Although the
              actual number of spires and towers in Prague is ranging from 500
              to over 1,000. It was most likely the obscure Austrian historian
              Josef Hormayr who first penned the phrase, in the early 19th
              century. It was also around that time that mathematician and
              philosopher Bernard Bolzano counted Prague’s towers and gave it
              the nickname.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though Prague has other nicknames such as "matka měst" –
              "mother of all cities", "zlatá Praha" – "golden Prague", "srdce
              Evropy" - "the heart of Europe", "kamenný sen" - "a stone dream"
              or "perla měst" - "the pearl of cities", the 100-spired nickname
              is used the most. Therefore when you visit Prague you should try
              to see and visit as many towers as you can. The most popular ones
              are easy to find.

                <p>
                  Historically the first and literally the longest Lokál - it
                  measures 73 meters on which we serve beer from 12 tanks and
                  where up to 1500 guests visit on a daily basis. Thanks to its
                  busy address in Prague’s city center it is always full and
                  lively, therefore you should probably book a table before you
                  visit.

                  In the morning, Local Lager is brewed and in the afternoon the

                  meeting of the two worlds – red for the beer brewing, blue for
                  cooling the drink before serving.
